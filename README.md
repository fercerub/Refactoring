# Refactoring
Refactoring example

This repository contains a step by step refactoring exercise.

In particular, it is an example taken from the first chapter of the book "Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Ed), by M. Fowler" and it is used to give the reader a sense of the refactoring process.

The description of the example, in M. Fowler's words is the following: "Imagine a company of theatrical players who go out to various events performing plays. Typically, a customer will request a few plays and the company charges them based on the size of the audience and the kind of play they perform. There are currently two kinds of plays that the company performs: tragedies and comedies. As well as providing a bill for the performance, the company gives its customers volume credits which they can use for discounts on future performances (think of it as a customer loyalty mechanism)".

The main function is "print_bill" which receives the invoice with the performances played to some customer and prints the corresponding bill.
